An efficient method for content reconstruction( references [13] and [4]) = Dristribution schemes
	- reference [5] lossless reconstruction with bit-wise accurace.
	Stego image is distorted but but image can be perfectly recovered
	-Refrence [14] High tamper rate but low restoration quality
	-allows for reconstruction with average PSNR of 37 dB. at 50% tamper rate
	-states that it is a special case o an erasur channel (page 4)
	
	general notes on paper.
		-they propose using the elements around the tapered are to help potentially recover the
		data that has been lost.
		-look at table page 14 on comparison between algorithms
		
image self embedding with high quality restoration capability
	-uses dynamic allocation of blocks depending on their degree of smoothness
	this means that rougher blocks have more bits for recovery and smooth blocks have less
	-bits embedded into 3LSB layers or cover
	
	general notes on paper.
	- This paper effectively describes a new way of compressing the image
	
High capacity reversible data embedding and content authentication
	- uses difference expansion (reference 7) and LSB embedding (reference 2)
	-Reference [6] difference expansion.
