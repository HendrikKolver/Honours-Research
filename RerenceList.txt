Watermarking and image recovery
-----------------------------------------

An efficient method for content reconstruction( references [13] and [4]) = Dristribution schemes
	- reference [5] lossless reconstruction with bit-wise accuracy.
	Stego image is distorted but but image can be perfectly recovered
	-Refrence [14] High tamper rate but low restoration quality
	-allows for reconstruction with average PSNR of 37 dB. at 50% tamper rate
	-states that it is a special case o an erasur channel (page 4)
	
	general notes on paper.
		-they propose using the elements around the tapered are to help potentially recover the
		data that has been lost.
		-look at table page 14 on comparison between algorithms
		
image self embedding with high quality restoration capability
	-uses dynamic allocation of blocks depending on their degree of smoothness
	this means that rougher blocks have more bits for recovery and smooth blocks have less
	-bits embedded into 3LSB layers or cover
	
	general notes on paper.
	- This paper effectively describes a new way of compressing the image
	
High capacity reversible data embedding and content authentication
	- uses difference expansion (reference 7) and LSB embedding (reference 2)
	-Reference [6] difference expansion.
	
Fragile Watermarking With Error-Free Restoration Capability
	- This scheme looks promising but the problem is the quality of the cover image.
		Compared to their references the cover image quality is less than some other 
		methods restored quality.
		The tradoff is that the restored quality is perfect but in my opinion it is pointless 
		because now you are sitting with a bad quality image that has to be restored the whole time
		just to get good quality
	- Because of this problem I would also say that the security is not very good because of the 
	visual distortion you can see something is wrong with the image.

Steganography Algorithms
-----------------------------------------
	
	
BPCS_Steg
	-This algorithm seems promising in the sense that it has massive capacity without much
	image distortion.
	-The Capacity does decrease though when using greyscale images rather than colour images
	-The security of this algorithm is not very good. It is suceptible to a histogram attack.
	-The algorithm is also not very robust since no effort is made to protect the message against 
	attacks. 
		This could potentially be a problem because the image will obviously be modified in my proposed
		application. 
		Further research must thus be done to ensure that there is possibly some redundancy in the message
		and that the message is spread properly across the image.
		As I see it you are effectively treating the multiple parts of the recovery data as seperate messages that
		will be embedded in the cover image
