At the moment I feel like my current direction and steps to follow would be:

-Study into current image self recovery algorithms 
	Compare strengts and weaknesses

-Study into current High capacity algorithms
	Compare strengtsh and weaknesses

-Choose a prommesing High capacity algorithm
-Choose a prommesing self recovery method which I can modify

-Attempt to apply the High capacity algorithm to the modified self recovery problem
	Experiment and test to find results


-Further research needs to be done into how information is spread in self embedding and recovery
through the cover image as to get good modifiability while still being able to recover the image 
effectively

-Look into if compression is needed or not
