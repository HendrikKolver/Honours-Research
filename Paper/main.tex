\section{Introduction}

\section{Current self embedding and recovery schemes and algorithms}

This section compares current Content reconstruction algorithms using self embedding.
This serves to give an overview of what is currently available and to possibly highlight shortcommings of the current algorithms.
This would be usefull to determine if the proposed method does indeed improve on existing methods. 
It would also help highlight strenghts and shortcommings in the proposed method.
